# BreakablePolearms
This is a simple mod that makes polearms break by giving them HP and dealing damage to them.

By default both non-swinging and swinging polearms are breakable. The HP of non-swinging polearms is 20 times their handling while the HP of swinging polearms is 40 times their handling.

When a polearm hits a living thing, it takes damage equal to 1 times the damage absorbed by armor. When a polearm hits a shield or other world object such as a gate, it takes damage equal to 10 times the damage inflicted.

Damage dealt to a polearm is reduced by a percentage equal to 0.33 times the wielder's Polearm skill.

You can configure what types of polearms to deal damage to, polearm HP, damage to polearms and damage reduction to polearms.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
